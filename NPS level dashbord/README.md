see it on [Tableau.public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/polina.ostroukhova/viz/NPS_made_up_project_eng/Story)   
This project presents the results of an NPS survey conducted among users of a telecommunications company.

The Tableau story visualizes:

1. General information about users and the brand’s NPS categories.
2. A description of the respondents—users who participated in the survey.
3. Comparison of 2 NPS categories: promoters and detractors.
4. Detailed view on users, who are loyal to our brand.
5. A deeper focus on the most loyal part of users - promoters.

Dashboards complement each other and reveal the key insight of NPS survey. Based on this data we've got portrait of loyal and unloyal clients of our brand and how NPS level differs depends on different properties.
