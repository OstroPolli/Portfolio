# NPS level dashboard
see it on [Tableau.public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/polina.ostroukhova/viz/NPS_made_up_project_eng/Story)   
This project presents the results of an NPS survey conducted among users of a telecommunications company.

The Tableau story visualizes:

1. General information about users and the brand’s NPS categories.
2. A description of the respondents—users who participated in the survey.
3. Comparison of 2 NPS categories: promoters and detractors.
4. Detailed view on users, who are loyal to our brand.
5. A deeper focus on the most loyal part of users - promoters.

The dashboards complement each other and highlight the key insights from the NPS survey. Based on this data, we have created a profile of both loyal and non-loyal customers of our brand, and how NPS levels vary across different characteristics.
