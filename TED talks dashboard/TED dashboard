3. TED Speakers: Here, information about the most active speakers, their field of activity, the number of talks they have given, and the popularity of their talks among viewers is presented.

4. Types of Conferences: This dashboard analyzes various types of TED conferences, their distribution over the years, popularity among the audience, and audience reactions to these conferences.
